# Geological modelling system

RCE is a distributed, workflow-based integration environment. Engineers and scientists use it to design and simulate complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites). Deep sea mining is the extraction of minerals from the seabed of the deep sea. Asteroid mining is the hypothetical extraction of materials from asteroids and other minor planets, including near-Earth objects. OpenJUMP Desktop-GIS software provides a swiss-knife of tools to analyze and edit huge GIS-datasets. Multi-Sensor 3D mapping with an unmanned ground vehicle for mining applications. Laser_RobMap is a ROS2 package designed for three-dimensional mapping using a two-dimensional LiDAR sensor mounted on a mobile robotic platform. The Geostatistics & Machine Learning C++ Library. Machine learning framework for reservoir simulation. Spatial and spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation. A Blender add-on with a collection of tools for 3D geological modelling, primarily designed for mineral exploration. It allows the import and visualization of drill holes and related interval data, point data, generation of simple block models, grade shell meshes, and integrates with the GemPy module for implicit geological modelling.
